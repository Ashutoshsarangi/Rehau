  "31-description": "The lower limit of the water pressure of 1 bar has been undercut.<br><br> Such low pressures are very unusual and may indicate, for example, a burst or leaking pipe in the house service line. This can lead to impairments of the leakage protection function, since, for example, the flow measurement can no longer work accurately due to air in the system. In addition, a leakage can no longer be reliably detected during the drop leakage test. Additionally, comfort losses must be expected, as only smaller quantities of water flow at the tapping points or the tapping temperatures fluctuate greatly.<br><br>If the water supplier has only such low pressures permanently available, the installation of a pressure booster system is recommended.",
  "32-description": "During the drop leakage measurement cycle, an unacceptably high pressure drop was detected.<br><br>This indicates that very small quantities of water are lost drop by drop somewhere in the drinking water installation.<br><br>The following could be a possible cause:<br><br>1. Dripping tap<br>2. Minimal leakage in the drain of the cistern, visible due to a permanent slight movement of water in the WC itself<br>3. Leakage at a thread connection <br><br> This is a particularly \"treacherous\" kind of the drop-leakage, because this thread-connection can be plastered also in the wall and one recognizes the damage only through wet walls and grounds, musty smell or mold formation.

This data includes surname, first name, address, e-mail address.<br><br> Please help us keep your information up-to-date by informing us of changes to your personal data, in particular your contact details.<br><br> We use all data provided by you to offer you the full functionality of the app and the control system. The legal basis for this processing is Art. 6 I lit. b GDPR. You can decide whether to provide us with all the necessary information and thus gain access to the full range of functions. For example, it is necessary to specify the address in order to be able to display the weather data for the location of the control system.

These measured values are processed in order to present you with various evaluations in the app. The evaluations include, for example, water consumption history, water temperature, water pressure and water flow rate.<br><br>Your saved settings can be used by you as a backup to restore the settings in the event of a failure of the control system, e.g. due to lightning strikes.<br><br> If you set individual thresholds for maximum flow rate, volume flow and removal time in the app, the data will be used to save and reuse settings you have made once. This also prevents different family members from making conflicting entries or settings.<br><br> In the same way that you make the data available to us, you can also delete the data yourself at any time.
